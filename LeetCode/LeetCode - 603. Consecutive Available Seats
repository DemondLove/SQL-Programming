/*
Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?
| seat_id | free |
|---------|------|
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
 

Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.
 

| seat_id |
|---------|
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
Note:
The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.).
Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.

WITH CTE AS (
SELECT
    seat_id
    , CAST(free AS int) AS free
    , CASE
        WHEN CAST(free AS int)+LAG(CAST(free AS int)) OVER(ORDER BY seat_id) = 2 THEN 1
        WHEN CAST(free AS int)+LEAD(CAST(free AS int)) OVER(ORDER BY seat_id) = 2 THEN 1
        ELSE 0
      END AS consecutive_free
FROM cinema
            ) 
            
SELECT
    seat_id
FROM CTE
WHERE consecutive_free = 1
